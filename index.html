                <h2>Genocide:</h2>
                <p>
                    Genocide refers to the intentional destruction of a particular group of people based on their ethnicity, religion, or nationality. In Gaza, there is a specific group of people, namely Gazans, whose identity has been split from greater Palestinians both physically through isolation and mentally through propaganda. 
                    Over a year and a few months, 44,000 confirmed Palestinians have been killed. 36,611 structures have been damaged with 8,578 of them being destroyed. Considering Gaza's population of 2.2 million, roughly 2% of the population has been killed in a little over a year. At this rate, the entire Gazan identity will disappear in approximately 60 years.

                <h2>Apartheid:</h2>
                <p>
                    Apartheid describes a system that inherently biases one group of people over another. In Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, there is a system of laws and policies that favor Israelis over Palestinians. Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank face severe restrictions on movement and limited access to resources like water and healthcare. They are limited in the roads that they can use and are forced to pass through extensive military checkpoints that Israelis are not required to enter. They are subject to military law, while Israeli settlers in these areas live under civil law with more freedom. Israel has also built a separation barrier, restricting Palestinians' access to their land, work, and families. Palestinians are prohibited from using natural springs and rain water as these resources are allocated for illegal Israeli settlers, and the amount of water given to Arab water companies is limited forcing Palestinians to ration their daily use.

                    <h2>Indiscriminate Attacks</h2>
                    <p>
                        Israeli airstrikes and shelling in densely populated areas like Gaza often hit civilian targets, such as homes, schools, and hospitals, killing and injuring innocent people. These attacks are considered indiscriminate because they do not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Israel is bombing everyone, regardless of their gender, race, or political affiliation. This is made clear in the Gaza death toll: over 46,000 people are dead and half of those are women and children. Both women and children are prohibited from joining Hamas, therefor it can be guaranteed that half of the killings in Gaza have been to civilians. That is assuming that the other 23,000 men are Hamas fighters, which they are not. Most people being affected by the bombing are not and have never been associated with Hamas.

                    <h2>Destruction of Places of Worship</h2>
                    <p>
                        Israeli airstrikes have targeted and destroyed religious sites, such as mosques and churches, as well as cultural and historical landmarks in Gaza, furthering the cultural erasure of Palestinian identity. This is prohibited by international laws however in the past year Israel has destroyed over 80 places of worship in Gaza. The third oldest church in the world is of those 80. Israel claims that the reason for this destruction is that these places are used as Hamas hideouts, however, there has been no evidence to support this and in fact, there has been countless videos online of little children hiding in churches being targeted.

                    <h2>Collective Punishment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Collective punishment refers to punishing individuals for the actions of others. Israel's blockades and military actions in Gaza often punish entire communities, restricting their access to food, medicine, and other necessities, in response to actions taken by militant groups. Israel claims that the goal of their attacks is to eradicate Hamas. This war was started to punish the group for October 7th however it is prohibited by international law to punish an entire group of people for the actions of some. Israel has undoubtedly done this. More than 2.3 million Gazans have been displaced from their homes, Israel has cut off the food and water supply to everyone living in Gaza, and more than 80% of the people dead have no affiliation with Hamas.

                    <h2>Targeting of Journalists</h2>
                    <p>
                        Journalists covering the conflict have been deliberately targeted by Israeli forces, with many killed or injured while reporting on the situation in Gaza. This is a violation of international law, which protects journalists in conflict zones. Since October 7th over 160 journalists have been killed in Gaza. Most of them were wearing their blue vest which is supposed to insinuate innocence similar to a white flag. Of those 160 many have been collateral damage as a result of the indeistrcitmnate bombing (which is also prohibited by international law) but another large portion of the killings has happened at close range with snipers. Israel intentionally targets journalists to minimize the global coverage that the atrocities they are committing get.
